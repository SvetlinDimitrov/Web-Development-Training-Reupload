1) loop trow the array to see how many levels are there , and get the avaible cordinates for each level
2) After having this now we can loop throw the data and start drawing rect .
3) each time a rect is drawn the cordinates for the next avaible rect on this level needs to be updated
4) each time when a rect is drawn the name should be saved in a set to not have dublications.
5) when the current rect is drawn it should loop throw the link array that it has and draw each rect that is linked to it.

This cpntinues until all the data is drawn.
